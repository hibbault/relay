## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Relay, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email us at: **relay_app@outlook.com**

Alternatively, you can use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/hibbault/relay/security/advisories/new) to report vulnerabilities privately.

Include the following in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Updates:** We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution:** We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days
- **Credit:** We will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The Relay desktop application
- All code in this repository

### Out of Scope

- Third-party dependencies (please report to their maintainers)
- Issues in user-provided API keys

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep your API keys secure** - Never share your `.env` file
2. **Review actions before approving** - Relay always asks for permission before system changes
3. **Keep Relay updated** - Install updates to get the latest security fixes

Thank you for helping keep Relay secure! 🔒
